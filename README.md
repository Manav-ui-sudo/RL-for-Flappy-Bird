Flappy Bird AI Agent using Q-Learning | Python Project

Built an autonomous Flappy Bird agent using Q-learning with state discretization and reward-based learning

Engineered game mechanics using Pygame and visualized training performance using Matplotlib

Achieved real-time gameplay decision-making by continuously updating Q-values based on agentâ€™s interactions
